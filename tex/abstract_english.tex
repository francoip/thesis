This thesis analyzes the security of Norwegian GSM and GPRS networks
using the OsmocomBB project, which aims to create a free and open source
GSM baseband software implementation. OsmocomBB was used to understand
the GSM system, and to understand and implement two types of attacks.
The first one is an eavesdropping attack, and the second one is a set of
Denial-of-Service attacks: the RACH flood attack, the IMSI attach flood
attack, the IMSI detach attack, and an attack based on race conditions
in the paging process.

The feasibility of these attacks on Norwegian networks was assessed. It
was found that both \comp{Telenor} and \comp{Netcom} seem protected from
the eavesdropping attack. The IMSI detach attack is effective on
\comp{Telenor}, but not on \comp{Netcom}. The other Denial-of-Service
attacks are probably effective, but were not tested since they could
damage the networks.
