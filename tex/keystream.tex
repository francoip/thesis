\chapter{Keystream patch}
\label{app:keystream}

This patch modifies the \prog{ccch\_scan} program of the
\code{sylvain/burst\_ind} branch to recover keystream in order to break
the encryption key.

To do so, knowing the downlink SACCH sequence is needed. This can be
found using Wireshark with the following filter while listening to a
transaction on the dedicated channel using the \prog{mobile}
application:

\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=left,
basicstyle=\footnotesize, breaklines=true, frame=single]
gsmtap.chan_type == 136 && gsmtap.uplink == 0
\end{lstlisting}

The following command can be used if the System Information messages
sequence is SI5, SI5ter, SI6 on the ARFCN 30:

\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=left,
basicstyle=\footnotesize, breaklines=true, frame=single]
sudo host/layer23/src/misc/ccch_scan -a 30 -q 5,5t,6,
\end{lstlisting}

It was developed on the \code{07ce6faff389dcaedc9b11ee4245d2a310f7612b}
commit of the \code{sylvain/burst\_ind} branch. It is also available at
\url{https://gitlab.com/francoip/thesis/raw/public/patch/keystream.patch}.
