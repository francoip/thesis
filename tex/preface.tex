\begin{abstract}

  This Master's thesis is the result of researches carried out over 22
  weeks during the spring semester in the Department of Telematics at
  the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. The NTNU has been
  my host university during a yearlong Erasmus exchange program, but
  this thesis is a requirement for the acquisition of the MSc in
  Electronics and Information Technology Engineering degree in the joint
  program between the two universities of Brussels: the Université
  Libre de Bruxelles, and the Vrije Universiteit Brussel.

  I would like to thank the people who helped me during these few
  months. Stig F. Mjølsnes, who gave me relevant advices, and guided me
  in the difficult process of academic writing. Jean-Michel Dricot, for
  introducing me to cellular networks and making this topic as
  interesting as he did. Many thanks also to all the \proj{OsmocomBB}
  developers for working on that great project, and to all the people
  who provided feedback during the writing process, especially Charles,
  Héloïse, and Pete. Finally, thanks a lot to Carole for supporting me!

  This thesis is distributed in the hope that it will be useful.
